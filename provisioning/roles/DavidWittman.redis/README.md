# ansible-redis

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DavidWittman/ansible-redis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DavidWittman/ansible-redis)

 - Requires Ansible 1.6.3+
 - Compatible with most versions of Ubuntu/Debian and RHEL/CentOS 6.x

## Installation

``` bash
$ ansible-galaxy install DavidWittman.redis
```

## Getting started

### Single Redis node

Deploying a single Redis server node is pretty trivial; just add the role to your playbook and go. Here's an example which we'll make a little more exciting by setting the bind address to 127.0.0.1:

``` yml
---
- hosts: redis01.example.com
  vars:
    - redis_bind: 127.0.0.1
  roles:
    - redis
```

``` bash
$ ansible-playbook -i redis01.example.com, redis.yml
```

**Note:** You may have noticed above that I just passed a hostname in as the Ansible inventory file. This is an easy way to run Ansible without first having to create an inventory file, you just need to suffix the hostname with a comma so Ansible knows what to do with it.

That's it! You'll now have a Redis server listening on 127.0.0.1 on redis01.example.com. By default, the Redis binaries are installed under /opt/redis, though this can be overridden by setting the `redis_install_dir` variable.

### Master-Slave replication

Configuring [replication](http://redis.io/topics/replication) in Redis is accomplished by deploying multiple nodes, and setting the `redis_slaveof` variable on the slave nodes, just as you would in the redis.conf. In the example that follows, we'll deploy a Redis master with three slaves.

In this example, we're going to use groups to separate the master and slave nodes. Let's start with the inventory file:

``` ini
[redis-master]
redis-master.example.com

[redis-slave]
redis-slave0[1:3].example.com
```

And here's the playbook:

``` yml
---
- name: configure the master redis server
  hosts: redis-master
  roles:
    - redis

- name: configure redis slaves
  hosts: redis-slave
  vars:
    - redis_slaveof: redis-master.example.com 6379
  roles:
    - redis
```

In this case, I'm assuming you have DNS records set up for redis-master.example.com, but that's not always the case. You can pretty much go crazy with whatever you need this to be set to. In many cases, I tell Ansible to use the eth1 IP address for the master. Here's a more flexible value for the sake of posterity:

``` yml
redis_slaveof: "{{ hostvars['redis-master.example.com'].ansible_eth1.ipv4.address }} {{ redis_port }}"
```

Now you're cooking with gas! Running this playbook should have you ready to go with a Redis master and three slaves.

### Redis Sentinel

#### Introduction

Using Master-Slave replication is great for durability and distributing reads and writes, but not so much for high availability. If the master node fails, a slave must be manually promoted to master, and connections will need to be redirected to the new master. The solution for this problem is [Redis Sentinel](http://redis.io/topics/sentinel), a distributed system which uses Redis itself to communicate and handle automatic failover in a Redis cluster.

Sentinel itself uses the same redis-server binary that Redis uses, but runs with the `--sentinel` flag and with a different configuration file. All of this, of course, is abstracted with this Ansible role, but it's still good to know.

#### Configuration

To add a Sentinel node to an existing deployment, assign this same `redis` role to it, and set the variable `redis_sentinel` to True on that particular host. This can be done in any number of ways, and for the purposes of this example I'll extend on the inventory file used above in the Master/Slave configuration:

``` ini
[redis-master]
redis-master.example.com

[redis-slave]
redis-slave0[1:3].example.com

[redis-sentinel]
redis-sentinel0[1:3].example.com redis_sentinel=True
```

Above, we've added three more hosts in the **redis-sentinel** group (though this group serves no purpose within the role, it's merely an identifier), and set the `redis_sentinel` variable inline within the inventory file.

Now, all we need to do is set the `redis_sentinel_monitors` variable to define the Redis masters which Sentinel should monitor. In this case, I'm going to do this within the playbook:

``` yml
- name: configure the master redis server
  hosts: redis-master
  roles:
    - redis

- name: configure redis slaves
  hosts: redis-slave
  vars:
    - redis_slaveof: redis-master.example.com 6379
  roles:
    - redis

- name: configure redis sentinel nodes
  hosts: redis-sentinel
  vars:
    - redis_sentinel_monitors:
      - name: master01
        host: redis-master.example.com
        port: 6379
  roles:
    - redis
```

This will configure the Sentinel nodes to monitor the master we created above using the identifier `master01`. By default, Sentinel will use a quorum of 2, which means that at least 2 Sentinels must agree that a master is down in order for a failover to take place. This value can be overridden by setting the `quorum` key within your monitor definition. See the [Sentinel docs](http://redis.io/topics/sentinel) for more details.

Along with the variables listed above, Sentinel has a number of its own configurables just as Redis server does. These are prefixed with `redis_sentinel_`, and are enumerated in the **Configurables** section below.


## Installing redis from a source file in the ansible role

If the environment your server resides in does not allow downloads (i.e. if the machine is sitting in a dmz) set the variable `redis_tarball` to the path of a locally downloaded tar.gz file to prevent a http download from redis.io.  
Do not forget to set the version variable to the same version of the tar.gz. to avoid confusion !

For example (file was stored in same folder as the playbook that included the redis role):
```yml
vars:
  - redis_version: 2.8.14
  - redis_tarball: redis-2.8.14.tar.gz
```
In this case the source archive is copied towards the server over ssh rather than downloaded.



## Configurables

Here is a list of all the default variables for this role, which are also available in defaults/main.yml. One of these days I'll format these into a table or something.
