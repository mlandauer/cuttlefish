# ===================================================
#
# Refer to the "Client Authentication" section in the PostgreSQL
# documentation for a complete description of this file.  A short
# synopsis follows.
#
# This file controls: which hosts are allowed to connect, how clients
# are authenticated, which PostgreSQL user names they can use, which
# databases they can access.  Records take one of these forms:
#

# host       DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# hostssl    DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# hostnossl  DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
#
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# Default:
#
local  all  postgres    trust
# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local  all  all    trust
# IPv4 local connections:
host  all  all  127.0.0.1/32  trust
# IPv6 local connections:
host  all  all  ::1/128  trust
